# Solar Power System Coverage in US States
# Abstract
DeepSolar is a solar installation database for the US, built by extracting information from satellite images. Photo voltaic panel installations are identified from over one billion image tiles covering all urban areas as well as locations in the US by means of an advanced machine learning framework. I have used the resulting data set to train an AdaBoost.M1 model to be capable of predicting if certain areas contain a high or low number of solar power systems based on social, economical and geographical factors. This model has the capacity to predict underutilised areas and help companies deploy solar power systems in optimal locations. I hope this model can assist in locating areas where solar power systems are most justified or needed.

# Motivation
Fossil fuel emissions affect social and environmental health â€“ clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter. The direct damage costs to health is estimated to be between USD 2-4 billion/year by 2030. After many decades of false starts, renewable energy is poised to one day challenge fossil fuels as the energy source of choice in America. For example, in 2018, 17.1% of electricity in the United States was generated from renewable sources. Solar panels are one of the leading sources of renewable energy. Despite the high upfront cost they have little maintenance expenses, are extremely environmentally friendly and can be considered insurance against rising electricity prices. Currently there are too few companies or governments invested in using the valuable insights derived from the available data sets. By understanding the dynamics at play and predicting under-utilised optimal locations for solar panels we can influence homeowners to invest in renewable energy and mitigate these risks.
